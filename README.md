The `kubectl history diff` command uses `diff -u -N` to compare revisions by default.
It also respects the `KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF` environment variable like the `kubectl diff` command.
To get a nicer diff view, you can use one of these:

```bash
# add color to the diff output
k history diff deploy demo | colordiff
# specify an external diff programm
KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF="colordiff -u" k history diff deploy demo
# show diff in VS Code
KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF="code --diff --wait" k history diff deploy demo
```
